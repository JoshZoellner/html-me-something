					<h2>My Favorite Baord Game: Scythe</h2>
					<p>I'll start with my favorite, Scythe. Scythe is made by Stonemaier Games and is the love child of Risk and Settlers on Catan. I'm sure there's a better analogy, but alas, it's what I have. Scythe is an engine building, worker placement, resource management strategy game with an asymmetrical setup for players (meaning it is <em>NOT</em> the same for every player). This provides endless posibilities for strategy and gameplay. Scythe is the perfect tool for farming and war, and that what this game is all about.</p>
               <p>Scythe is a little heavy and takes some time to reach through the rules (took us 1.5 hours the first time!), but makes sense and plays beautifully once you get the hang of it, which doesn't take long. There are so many ways to play and strategies to impliment in Scythe which is why I love it. Not only that, but it has great gameplay mechanics and is a fantastically beautiful game all around.</p>

					<h2>Best "Game-Night" Game: Catan</h2>
					<p>Who doesn't love Catan? If you haven't played Catan yet, you've probably been living under a rock. Every household should own this game as it's essential to any board game collection, whether you are an enthusiast or not. It's fairly easy to play and set up once you know what you're doing - the initial playthrough will take a little linger to get familiar with the rules and gameplay. Bot oh, is it worth it!</p>
               <p>Catan is uses stragety and the luck of the dice roll to generate resources. Players then use those resources to build roads and cities. Players can trade resources with each other or use the robber and steal from another player to better their position. It's intensely fun and competetive and the amount of satisfaction you get when you get a good roll can't be beat! This is my #1 go-to for game night. It's a medium weight game that is not as daunting as Scythe but still delivers a great gaming experience.</p>

					<h2>Best Two-Player Game: Carcassonne</h2>
               <p>Carcassonne is one of my wife's favorite games, and for good reason! It's very lightweight but it quite competitive. There's not a lot of set up for Carcassonne, or rules. You should be ready to play in 15 mins for your first game. After that, set up is a breeze.</p>
               <p>Carcassonne is a tile and worker placement game, but mostly focuses on the tiles. Players take turns drawing random tiles and building the landscape of "Carcassonne". Players then may place their meeples on roads, in citys, or as a farmer in a field. Players gain points for completing those structures and the player with the most points at the end wins! We play this about once a week once the kids go to bed.</p>

					<h2>Best Party Game: Secret Hitler</h2>
					<p>Alright, so as far as party games go, Secret Hitler wins by a landslide. This game pits "Liberals" and "Fascists" against each other using the arts of deception and perception. And just like real life politics, you don't know who is one which side! Just kidding ;) the fascists always know who each other are.</p>
               <p>The goal in Secret Hitler is simple, but not easily accomplished. Liberals try to figure out who is Hitler and either assassinate him or pass enough liberal laws through legislature. The Fascists all know who Hitler is, but hitler does not know anyone's identity. They are working togetherto pass fascists laws and elect Hitler as Chancellor. You'll never so much fun calling your friends a fascist, I promise.</p>

					<h2>Best Co-op Board Game: Pandemic</h2>
               <p>Pandemic was a game changer for me. I had never heard of a co-op board game and this one is really difficult to beat, meaning you and your friends have to work together as a well-oiled machine or you all die together. Sound fun, right!? It totally is.</p>
               <p>Players team up in Pandemic and take on a different roles, each with unique ability, in an effort to stop a global Pandemic from happening. Sounds like the WHO couldv'e use this before the corona-- never mind. Anyway, things happen fast in Pandemic, with a potential outbreak at every turn, players <em>must</em> communicate with each other and work as a team to find the cure for 5 deadly plagues. You either win together, or you lose together. There are levels of difficulty depending on your experience with the game, so it makes for a challenge and uniquely fun experience for a small group. did I mention it's really hard?</p>
